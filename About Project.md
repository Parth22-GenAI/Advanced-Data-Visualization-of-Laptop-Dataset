# Advanced-Data-Visualization-of-Laptop-Dataset
This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates advanced data visualization techniques applied to a comprehensive laptop price dataset. The analysis includes data preprocessing, handling missing values, and statistical summaries. Various visualizations, such as pie charts, count plots, histograms, and scatter plots, are used to explore relationships between laptop specifications (such as RAM, screen size, and resolution) and their prices.

# Key features of the notebook:

1.Data overview and preprocessing steps
2.Statistical summaries for numerical and categorical data
3.Visualizations of company distributions, price variations, and correlations between laptop features
4.Insights derived from the visualizations to aid decision-making


This project showcases the application of libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for effective data analysis and visualization. The dataset used can be beneficial for anyone interested in understanding laptop pricing trends and features.

# Technologies Used:

-Python
